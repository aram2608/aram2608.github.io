C++ structs are useful for a number of things, as simple POD objects or for more
complex needs.

Overview
===

C++ structs are essentialy a class. The only difference is that all members are
public by default, meaning they can be accessed anywhere in a program.

Declaring and Defining a Struct
---

Like every object in C++, they need to be declared prior to definition.

```C++
// Struct declaration
struct Foo {
  int x;
  int y;
}

// Structs can be constructed 
// with designated initializers
Foo foo{
  .x = 4,
  .y = 5,
};

// We can also make a struct 
// with a constructor function
struct Bar {
  // This function is called whenever
  // we make a new Bar object
  Bar(int x, int y) : x(x), y(y) {}

  int x;
  int y;
}

// We can now create our object with
// list initialization
Bar bar{4, 5};
```

Using Structs
---

Once your struct is created, you can access its members anywhere in a program.

``` C++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  // We first construct our object
  Foo foo{
    .x = 4,
    .y = 5,
  };
  // We can access the member and print to terminal
  std::cout << foo.x << std::endl;

  // We can even use them in expressions
  std::cout << foo.y + 5 << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Private Members
---

Members in a struct can be set to private, why you would do this I am not sure but
you definitely can.

``` C++
#include <iostream>
struct PrivateFoo {
  PrivateFoo(int x): x(x) {}
  private:
    int x;
}

int main() {
  PrivateFoo pf{4};

  // This would not compile!
  std::cout << pf.x << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
