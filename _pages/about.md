Hey Faith!

I’m a microbiologist and developing bioinformatician interested in how microbes 
interact with their environments and hosts. I currently study the 
actinobacteria _Frankia_ at the University of New Hampshire, where I use RNA-seq and 
comparative genomics to uncover the molecular signals that shape symbiotic 
relationships. I enjoy translating large biological datasets into meaningful 
insights through Python and R, and I am passionate about building tools that 
support biological discovery. Outside the lab, I love teaching microbiology 
and helping students gain confidence at the bench.

When I’m not in the teaching lab or digging through sequencing data, you’ll 
usually find me outdoors. I love hiking, fishing, and exploring new places, 
especially when I get to meet new people along the way. I’m also a big fan of 
programming projects outside of biology and stats, whether it’s making small games, 
tinkering with compilers and interpreters, or designing tools/software
just for fun. I enjoy the challenge of learning new systems and the creative
freedom that comes with building something from scratch.
